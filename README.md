# Comment Cap on Posts

This app allows moderators to perform actions when a post reached a certain threshold limit.

## Features

**Upon crossing the comment threshold (minimum of 2 comments), the following actions can be taken (in almost any combination):**

- Apply post flair (using template ID)
- Apply post flair text (as per template ID or custom)
- Add a comment (automatically locked, distinguised, and stickied)
- Lock the entire post
- Send a message to modmail with a link to the post
- If a post flair already exists, toggle flair override
- Posts with specific flairs to not trigger on
- Also taking requests!

### Notes

Any post that has already been triggered once will not be triggered again, even if the post count goes down again.
